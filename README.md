# Algorithms

Algorithms of interest and example usage in the real world. These are artifacts
that I've made while thinking about coding challenges or domain-specific
problems in my career.

If you like any of these, feel free to use them as long as you credit me as the

* [**Shortest path example**](shortest_path)
   * This is a common code challenge. I best remember it from interviews with
     Google and Counsyl. Google directly asked it as shortest path given a map.
     Counsyl was a bit more sneaky and posed it as reassembly of chunks of data
     from a satellite that were repeated, varied in length and arrived out of order.
