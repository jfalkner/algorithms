# Algorithms

Algorithms of interest and example usage in the real world. These are artifacts
that I've made while thinking about coding challenges or domain-specific
problems in my career.

If you like any of these, feel free to use them as long as you credit me as the
author and link back to this repo.

### Checking this guy's GitHub

If you are doing a normal, deeper dig in to my repo to gauge if I can code, here
are a few examples to focus on. The bigger list below is probably more time than
you want to spend here.

| Algorithm       | Type     | Desc                                                                                       |
|-----------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Shortest Path](code/shortest_path/README.md)   | Graph    | Common CS concept but non-trivial algorithm                                                |
| [Making Change](code/making_change/README.md)   | Dynamic Programming | Common CS concept and clever code interview question                                                |
| [Finding Repeats](code/finding_repeats/README.md) | FizzBuzz | Sneaky can-you-code question with easy followups for "can it be improved" style questions. |

### All Algorithms

Full list of stuff in this repo. Sorted loosely by type.
